Ecommerce Fraud Detection Pipeline
Overview
This project demonstrates real-time fraud detection for an eCommerce platform using a big data pipeline. It involves data ingestion, storage, processing, and visualization using cutting-edge technologies.

Key Features:

Real-time data ingestion with Kafka.
Data storage and management in HBase.
Fraud detection analytics using Apache Spark.
Visualization of results through a real-time dashboard.
Prerequisites
Ensure the following software is installed on your system:

Docker: For containerized deployment.
Node.js: For Kafka producer scripts.
Python 3.x: For data processing and dashboard scripts.
Getting Started
1. Start the Docker Cluster
To start all necessary services (Kafka, Spark, HBase, etc.), run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
2. Kafka Setup
a. Create Kafka Topics
Run the following command to create the necessary topic for transactions:

bash
Copy code
kafka-topics --create --topic transactions --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 3
b. Run Kafka Producer
Navigate to the Kafka producer folder and start sending real-time transaction data:

bash
Copy code
cd kafka-producer
node producer.js
3. HBase Setup
a. Create an HBase Table
To store transaction data, create a table in HBase with the following schema:

bash
Copy code
create 'fraud_detection_tbl', 'transaction_data', 'customer_data'
4. Configure Spark
a. Access the Spark Master Container
Bash into the spark-master container:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it spark-master bash
b. Install Required Dependencies
Install necessary packages inside the container:

bash
Copy code
apt update
apt install -y build-essential
pip install happybase
5. Run the Fraud Detection Script
a. Copy the Fraud Detection Script
Ensure the fraud_detection.py script is copied to the spark-master container.

b. Run the Fraud Detection Script
Execute the Spark job to analyze transactions for potential fraud:

bash
Copy code
spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.5.4 fraud_detection.py
The fraud detection results will be stored in HBase.

Dashboard
Access the Dashboard
After running the fraud detection pipeline, view the results on the dashboard:

plaintext
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
The dashboard will display:

Real-time transaction monitoring.
Identified fraudulent transactions.
Statistics and insights.
Technology Stack
