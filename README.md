Ecommerce Fraud Detection Pipeline:

Overview:
This project demonstrates real-time fraud detection for an eCommerce platform using a big data pipeline. It involves data ingestion, storage, processing, and visualization using cutting-edge technologies.

Key Features:
Real-time data ingestion with Kafka.

Data storage and management in HBase.

Fraud detection analytics using Apache Spark.

Visualization of results through a real-time dashboard.



Prerequisites:
Ensure the following software is installed on your system:

Docker: For containerized deployment.

Node.js: For Kafka producer scripts.

Python 3.x: For data processing and dashboard scripts.


Getting Started

1. Start the Docker Cluster.
   
To start all necessary services (Kafka, Spark, HBase, etc.), run:

docker-compose up -d.



3. Kafka Setup:
   
a. Create Kafka Topics

Run the following command to create the necessary topic for transactions:

kafka-topics --create --topic transactions --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 3.

b. Run Kafka Producer:

Navigate to the Kafka producer folder and start sending real-time transaction data:

cd kafka-producer

node producer.js.


3.HBase Setup:

a. Create an HBase Table

To store transaction data, create a table in HBase with the following schema:

create 'fraud_detection_tbl', 'transaction_data', 'customer_data'.

4. Configure :

a. Access the Spark Master Container

Bash into the spark-master container:

docker exec -it spark-master bash.

b. Install Required Dependencies:

Install necessary packages inside the container:

apt update

apt install -y build-essential

pip install happybase.



5. Run the Fraud Detection Script:
   
a. Copy the Fraud Detection Script

Ensure the fraud_detection.py script is copied to the spark-master container.

b. Run the Fraud Detection Script:

Execute the Spark job to analyze transactions for potential fraud:

spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.5.4 fraud_detection.py

The fraud detection results will be stored in HBase.




Dashboard:

Access the Dashboard.

After running the fraud detection pipeline, view the results on the dashboard:

http://localhost:3000.



The dashboard will display:

Real-time transaction monitoring.

Identified fraudulent transactions.

Statistics and insights.

Technology Stack:

Ingestion: Kafka, Node.js.

Purpose: Real-time data streaming.

Storage: HBase, Hadoop.

Purpose: Big data storage.

Processing: Apache Spark.

Purpose: Fraud detection analytics.

Visualization: Python (Dash).
